- 👋 Hi, I’m @MrBedrock225
- 👀 I’m interested in being able to create all those things that I saw as a child and try to recreate them in my own way.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to program, model, animate, and some other things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Minecraft projects that have to do with the creation of mods, since I want to create mods to entertain people.
- 😄 Pronouns: MrBedrock,  AgentCat,  Cat
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am 14 years old, and I want to take advantage of every day of my life to fulfill my goal of making people have fun with my mods and being important to a group of people.
